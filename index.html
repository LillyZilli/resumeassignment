            <h2>Graphic Designer</h2>

            <p>Hello! My name is Lilly and I am a digital and print graphic designer. My passion for design stems from childhood, where my creativity thrived through crayons and scraps of paper. In high school, I took a course on graphic design and quickly discovered my passion for design. </p>
            <p>Other passions I have outside of graphic design are water color painting, cooking, hiking, and watching movies.</p>

                <p>I was hired to create a logo for a local travel agency to use to promote a short series of videos advertising different travel destinations. The photo I was sourced with needed quite a bit of editing. The background and details were all digitally created.  </p>
